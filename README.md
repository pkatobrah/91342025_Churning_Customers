# 91342025_Churning_Customers
The project aimed to develop a deep learning churn prediction model to assist telecom operators in predicting potential customer churn. 
It involves extracting relevant features from the dataset to define customer churn and using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify customer profiles related to churning. 
The model's accuracy was  evaluated, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score was calculated to assess its predictive performance. 
Finally, streamlit was used to  host the churn prediction model, allowing users to input new data for churn prediction and providing a confidence factor for the prediction. 
Overall, the project aimed to reduce customer churn and increase retention for telecom operators by leveraging deep learning techniques.
